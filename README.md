The Heart That Fed is a real-time civilization management game wherein you play as an Egyptian pharaoh from 1279 to 1213 BC. Your objective is to construct a statue in your image. To accomplish this, you must direct your workers to one of three roles -- industry, farming, and construction -- and maintain balance while juggling short-term crises like famine and revolts. Step into the power-tripping pharaoh’s shoes, and see if your legacy will last.
